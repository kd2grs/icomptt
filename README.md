PTT program for ICOM radios, enables RTS signaling to key radio

This software allows ham radio programs that key the radio via RS-232 pin setting (e.g. assert RTS pin) to key up (active transmit) on an ICOM radio via CAT commands. This program is primarily used to allow [Direwolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf) and [UZ7HO](uz7.ho.ua/packetradio.htm) soundmodem TNC software to key up ICOM IC-7100, IC-7200 and IC-9100 radios. It is designed to run on Windows 7 or Windows 10 computers and it requires the .NET framework and com0com virtual NULL modem software to run.
